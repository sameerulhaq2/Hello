# Text Analytics on Movie reviews
# Dataset
The selected dataset for this assignment is the IMDB Dataset of Movie Reviews and Translation from Kaggle.com. It comprises 150k records of movie reviews, including ratings (1-10 scale), movie titles, and English and Portuguese translated reviews. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis by converting the ratings into binary values, distinguishing positive and negative sentiments. The dataset's diversity enables a comprehensive text analysis model to be built, covering various movie categories. Ratings from 1 to 4 are considered negative sentiments, while ratings from 5 to 10 represent positive sentiments. The review section contains valuable text comments from IMDB users, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks.
